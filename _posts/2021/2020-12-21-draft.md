Is there a more magical time in the fantasy season than just after the draft? You're riding that sweet post draft high, your team is full of potential. No games have been played yet so there's no actual evidence that your team is trash. It's a beautiful thing.

Tanvir are you okay? Did you somehow go temporarily blind during the draft? Could you not see the players you were drafting, forcing you to just click randomly on the screen and pray for the best? That's the only way I can explain this pile of dog shit. Wow.

Drafting can be difficult, even for long time fantasy vets. It was a tough year to have a late pick and this team is evidence of it. The KD pick is a risk (I'm actually on board with it though), but one that could pan out big, especially if KD returns to his normal self.

I don't even hate this team that much, I think it's mostly fine, but drafting Ja Morant at 19 when Kyrie Irving and Paul George are still available is unforgiveable, automatic failing grade.

I don't necessarily have a problem with taking Luka 3rd (personally I'd never pass up on Harden). I don't necessarily have a problem with taking Ben Simmons in the second round. I do have a problem with taking them both. Normally your first two draft picks are supposed to be players that complement each other, drafting Simmons and Luka is like taking the same player twice... I could be totally wrong here and maybe it'll work out, this team will definitely be okay in the three main counting stats. The %'s and stocks are going to be a struggle though, which is usually a recipe for fantasy disaster.

# 8. Faisal

> Draft grade: <span style="color: red">D</span>

It's no secret that I've never been a big fan of Faisal's teams in the past, this year isn't much different. His team this year is confusing to me and I'm not sure how to rate it. Having low FG% while also not being strong in PTS is concerning, but there's always an 18+ppg scorer to be found in the first few weeks of the waiver wire. John Wall has looked great so far in preseason, and with Harden potentially on his way out in Houston he could have a stellar season.

# 7. Josh

> Draft grade: <span style="color: orange">C-</span>

In a draft where most people were targetting bigs Josh seemed to do the opposite. It's a guard heavy team that could see some success just by having different strengths than most of the other teams. Would have given this team a better grade if more had been done with the last few picks.

I'm not very high on this team either, but it gets a pass because it at least makes sense from a fantasy perspective. Not overly strong in any particular category, but it's average in more than enough. This grade is more out of respect for the three time champ than anything else.

Probably the consensus best team in the league going into the season. Would have given him a higher grade but he had a high pick and he's been annoying as fuck about how good he thinks his team is. Paul George falling to 23 was a gift that he didn't deserve.

Possibly the greatest team ever drafted in the history of this league. Back-to-back Ball brothers picks was fucking inspired. Sealing the trifecta with LiAngelo was *chef's kiss*. Just give him the championship now, he's earned it.
